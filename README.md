Running list of useful info for incoming LSHTM Public Health & Policy RD candidates<p>

<b> NEWS & COMMS </b> <br>
1. Departmental intros – Each department organizes their own induction, but worth getting in touch with Joanna Bending to check on contacts and listservs if you have not been contacted yet.<br> 
For PHES, the department head is the very nice Mark Petticrew and you can probably reach out to him, but not sure who is coordinating comms at the moment. Steve Cummins/Kathryn Oliver are the DRDCs. For HSRP, Debby Stanley can get you on the listserv and Alec Miners/Mary-Alison Durand are the DRDCs. We usually have an occasional newsletter from HSRP as well as PHP, and a departmental seminar every month or so. PIRU/PSSRU organise further meetings if your research falls under those programmes. For GHD, you should contact Jack Butterworth to be on departmental comms and Lorraine Bacchus/Shelley Lees are the DRDCs. Everyone should be meeting with DRDCs in the next ~6 months or so.
<p>
2.	Listservs – It is worth keeping an eye on all-PHP and RD comms like this year’s seminar series that Kara just announced.
Probably you should also sign up for email announcements from various centres and groups here (use “search for lists”): https://lists.lshtm.ac.uk/sympa/home. <br>
A list of the 14 Centres: https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres-projects-groups/centres. Please note that particular page is non-exhaustive, as further topic research groups exist (e.g. the Cancer Survival Group, NTD Network) and there are other institutional/methods groups and big grant-funded programmes that may be of interest at LSHTM, eg I participate in Decolonising Global Health and the R Users Group. Do ask your supervisor and colleagues or keep an eye out in Chariot and events. Centres are self-governing and some have Slack/Teams/etc in addition to the listserv. <br> 
This can quickly flood your inbox, but is useful for hearing about seminars and collaborations relevant to your work.

<b> SKILLS & TRAINING </b>
3.	Timetable for taught modules is here (https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/study/courses/short-courses/modules-london#modulessee, see the pdf/xls link as well). Terms map with the academic calendar here (https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/term-and-holiday-dates).
 
Notably, future dates are a bit harder to pin down as the School figures out what to do in 2021. FYI there are usually reading weeks around UK half-term dates in fall and spring, as well as a ~2-week Easter break, but this may change this year and everyone has their own personal leave schedule.

 
4.	Distance learning (DL) modules may work for your schedule and are listed here (https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/study/courses/short-courses/modules-dl) – like “F2F”courses, the fees should be covered by your funder in most cases. Additional short courses, e.g. 2-week course on Clinical Trials or 1-day masterclass on Instrumental Variables, are announced ad hoc by the departments or centres running them. So check the relevant mailing lists, or ask around among colleagues.

 
5.	“Auditing” module content – if you are unable to sign up for a full module per Joanna’s email or only want to use the content for reference, use this link to sign up for as many as you want… (https://gate.lshtm.ac.uk/forms/moodlestaff/) …with your LSHTM credentials to self-enrol for Moodle (VLE) materials. 

You will have to restart Moodle to see the course materials in your left-hand panel. Worth checking previous years for further materials, e.g. some organisers have left up past video/audio recordings.
 
When you self-enrol, you access materials but it is assumed you will not participate directly in discussions or formative assessment. If you want the latter, you should definitely use the module sign-up form and confirm with the module organisers. Some may be happy to make time to give you informal assessment or direct research feedback as colleagues.
 
This is also the usual procedure to access class materials if you are helping to teach or assess on a module as staff.
 

6.	External modules and training – LSHTM doesn’t have a great central system signposting this.
 
You should always be able to join external training if it strongly relates to your thesis and relevant research budget is available. In general, you should propose and organize your own training according to whatever you think you need for your thesis – including anything you need outside the School, e.g. microeconomic theory at Birkbeck – but have your supervisor sign off on the time and grant investment.
 
For example, for ESRC- (and maybe all UKRI?) funded students, there are many training opportunities beyond subdomain-specific conferences and workshops, which are offered to all of the Bloomsbury postgrad network in both “hard” and “soft” skills. See:
•	https://www.ncrm.ac.uk/training/
•	https://doctoral-skills.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury/lista-z.pht?option=new
 
Other funders like MRC and Wellcome often convene further meetings and training. The networks differ in who can attend (usually it is a mixed group of researchers at various stages anyway), but with all uni short courses usually first-come, first-serve and a sliding scale for grant-funded fees if any.
 
Feel free to ping me directly on causal inference/ML training, e.g. Robins’ and Hernan’s text.
 
 
<b> TEACHING AND OTHER PART-TIME WORK OPPORTUNITIES </b>
7.	Module support – Ultimately each organiser makes the final call on additional staff to support teaching and marking on their module. It is worth asking your supervisor in the first instance, who probably teaches on at least one module and presumably has the same disciplinary and/or topic focus as you.

Hannah Babad as PHP Head of Taught Programmes normally organises a Faculty-wide call that supports the match-making process beyond personal networks. I’m not sure when her next request is coming via php-admin and how many roles will be available given virtual teaching this year. The last call for Term 1 teaching came at the end of July. I would imagine a call for Terms 2 and 3 will be out in December; they circulate a questionnaire that is then returned to Nicola Fagg. 

The union (UCU) has negotiated a standard rate of with LSHTM on all time spent by RD students on teaching and module demonstration. Typical casual (i.e. ZHC) contract seminar/marking support might be ~6-30 hours for any given module. Seminar leader notes and mark schemes are kept up to date by module organisers, but typically you should be able to contribute your experience and critical knowledge. There is an initial mandatory training for all student-contact roles and some necessary form-filling. DL teaching uses a somewhat different system that I don’t know as well, but Joanna may have more info.
 
8.	Invigilation, assessments, etc – further emails are sent ad hoc when help is needed and this is paid at different rates, eg there may also be a School-wide call on the alumni fundraising telephone campaign, or someone may reach out to their course director for referral to additional private tutoring for MSc exams. There are also occasional calls for short-term RA/RF-type roles, e.g. lit review support, circulated on various listservs.
 
9.	External work – your supervisor should sign off in all circumstances, but in the past, RD students with the relevant background have also taught nearby at places like UCL. LSHTM does not organise this. If this is something you want to do, jobs.ac.uk is probably your first port of call.
